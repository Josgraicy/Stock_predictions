# Stock_predictions
Overview
This project is dedicated to predicting the movement of the S&P 500 stock market index. Utilizing a machine learning approach, we've developed a model based on the RandomForestClassifier algorithm from the scikit-learn library. The model has been trained and tested on historical S&P 500 data, and through iterative enhancements, we've achieved a prediction accuracy of nearly 60%.

Features
Data Processing: Scripts to clean and prepare historical S&P 500 data for training and testing.
Model Training: A RandomForestClassifier model is trained on a set of features derived from historical stock market data.
Accuracy Improvement: Techniques employed to tune the model and improve prediction accuracy, including hyperparameter optimization and feature engineering.
Prediction: A system to make daily predictions on the direction of the S&P 500 index movement.
Evaluation: Metrics and methods to evaluate the model's performance over time.
Requirements
Python 3.8+
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib (for visualization)
Model Improvement
The initial version of our model predicted the movement of the S&P 500 index with about 40% accuracy, which is no better than random chance. Through a series of improvements, including hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and incorporating more nuanced market indicators, we were able to elevate our model's accuracy to nearly 60%.
